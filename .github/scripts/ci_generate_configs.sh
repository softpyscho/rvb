# One program for both pools. The stable and beta generators used to be separate
# ~25-line jq copies; they differed in exactly three things, all expressed via
# $channel below, and any rule change had to be applied twice in lockstep.
#
#   $channel   "stable"/"beta": the inherited default written by $force, and the
#              channel whose date fields feed $app_update_ok.
#   $active / $activePatchApps / the config and output paths: per pool.
#   app_update_ok: an app-version bump only pulls an app into the BETA pool when
#              one of its sources really has beta_date > stable_date, because
#              otherwise the stable pool already covers that app. The stable pool
#              has no such condition, so it is vacuously satisfied there.
#
# Quoted heredoc: no shell expansion, so jq's single-quoted strings stay ordinary
# single quotes instead of the '\'' maze the copies used.
