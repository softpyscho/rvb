# Prune the update branch:
#  1. Channel-pointer JSON (stable/*.json, beta/*.json) whose download pointer
#     is dead — the zipUrl asset no longer exists on the archive release it
#     names (manual asset removal or rotation past the retention window both
#     qualify), or, for numbered-release pointers, the release itself was
#     deleted. A still-built slug always refreshes its pointer from the newest
#     build, so pruning dead ones loses nothing: next build recreates them.
#  2. changelogs/<tag>.md for releases that no longer exist and are no longer
#     referenced by any surviving pointer.
#
# The branch layout is a wire format: module zips bake
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<repo>/update/<channel>/<name>.json
# at build time (update_json_path in scripts/utils.sh), so files are only ever
# deleted here, never moved or renamed.
