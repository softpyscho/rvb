# Config

Adding another revanced app is as easy as this:
```toml
[Some-App]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app"
# or uptodown-dlurl = "https://app.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a patch name itself contains a single quote, double it inside the string (e.g. 'Hide ''Get Music Premium''').

## More about other options:

There exists an example below with all defaults shown and all the keys explicitly set.  
**All keys are optional** (except download urls) and are assigned to their default values if not set explicitly.  

```toml
compression-level = 9                # module zip compression level
remove-rv-integrations-checks = true # remove checks from the revanced integrations
dpi = "320dpi nodpi"            # dpi packages to be searched in order. 'auto' matches whatever is available. default: "nodpi anydpi auto"

patches-source = "revanced/revanced-patches" # where to fetch patches bundle from. default: "MorpheApp/morphe-patches"
patches-source-host = "github"               # source host for patches: "github", "gitlab" or "codeberg". default: "github"
cli-source = "ReVanced/revanced-cli"             # where to fetch cli from. default: "MorpheApp/morphe-desktop"
cli-source-host = "github"                       # source host for cli: "github", "gitlab" or "codeberg". default: "github"
# options like cli-source can also set per app
brand = "Morphe"                     # patch brand/engine identity (e.g. "ReVanced Advanced", "Piko", "Morphe", "Android TV"). default: patches-source owner.

author = "nullcpy"                   # module author name. default: "nullcpy"
author-page = "github.com/nullcpy/rvb" # module author page/link printed during installation. default: "github.com/nullcpy/rvb"

patches-version = "stable"  # 'stable', 'beta', 'both', or a version number. default: "stable"
cli-version = "stable"      # 'stable', 'beta', or a version number. default: "stable"
# 'stable' and 'beta' are the only channel keywords; a keyword resolves against
# state/patch_sources.json (see Pool Routing below). 'both' is routing, not a channel.

> [!TIP]
> **File-Level Defaults in Modular Configs:**  
> Keys defined at the top of the file before the first `[...]` section (such as `patches-source`, `cli-source`, `patches-version`, `brand`, `variant`, `arch`, and `build-mode`) act as file-level defaults for all apps in that file. Apps automatically inherit them unless overridden.

# A requested arch is a hard requirement: a build is produced only when a download
# actually carries that ABI (or is universal / has no native code at all). A wrong
# single ABI is rejected and the next source tried; if none supplies the arch, that
# channel is simply not built - never shipped under another arch's name. So an
# arm64-only app publishes only its arm64 artifact and no arm-v7a file, and the
# reverse. Universal bundles serve both channels from one fetch.

# 'auto' option gets the latest possible version supported by all the included patches
# 'exp' gets the latest experimental version from patches.json. falls back to 'latest' if none found.
# 'latest' gets the latest stable without checking patches support. 'beta' gets the latest beta/alpha
# whitespace seperated list of patches to exclude. default: ""
version = "auto"     # 'auto', 'exp', 'latest', 'beta' or a version number (e.g. '17.40.41'). default: auto

# can also be set to an explicit versionCode (e.g. '473623755') or mapped per-architecture ('arm64-v8a: 473623755 | arm-v7a: 473623748').
# used by APKMirror and the cache repo to pick the exact build variant, and enforced on

# Also part of the stock-APK cache key (<pkg>-<version>-<code>-<arch>), so two builds that

### Naming & Catalog Hierarchy

The declarative keys define both the asset filename and how the app appears in release notes and the website catalog:
- **`app-name`**: Sets the human-readable display name (e.g. `YouTube`, `Instagram`, `Prime Video`).
- **`brand`**: Declares the canonical patch brand or creator identity (e.g. `ReVanced Advanced`, `Piko`, `Adobo`, `Paresh`, `Android TV`, `Morphe`).
- **`variant`**: (Optional) Declares visual or feature variations (e.g. `Nord`, `Mocha`, `MaterialYou`).
- **`sub-variant`**: (Optional) Declares packaging or installation variations (e.g. `clone`, `alt`).
- **`pkg-name`**: Sets the upstream stock application package name (e.g. `com.amazon.amazonvideo.livingroom`), used by scrapers (APKMirror, Uptodown) and patch bytecode checkers.
- **`patched-pkg-name`**: (Optional) Declares the resulting installed package name when changed by a clone patch (e.g. `com.amazon.amazonvideo.livingroom.clone`). Used by the website catalog and Obtainium for installation tracking. If omitted on cloned apps, the build engine automatically extracts the real package ID from the built APK's manifest using `aapt2`.

#### Direct Slug Resolution

The build engine (`utils.sh`) automatically derives filename slugs directly from your declarative configuration using clean kebab-casing:
- `brand = "ReVanced Advanced"` ➔ `revanced-advanced` (or `brand = "Anddea"` ➔ `anddea`)
- `brand = "Android TV"` ➔ `android-tv`
- `brand = "Piko"` ➔ `piko`
- `brand = "Morphe"` ➔ `morphe`
- `app-name = "YouTube Music"` ➔ `youtube-music`

Every configuration is self-contained in its TOML file with zero external lookup files.

**Output Filename Structure:**
```
${app_slug}-${brand_slug}${variant:+-$variant}${sub_variant:+-$sub_variant}-v${version}-${arch}.apk
```

Examples:
- `app-name = "YouTube"`, `brand = "ReVanced Advanced"`, `variant = "Nord"` ➔ `youtube-revanced-advanced-nord-v20.51.39-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "YouTube Music"`, `brand = "Anddea"` ➔ `youtube-music-anddea-v8.11.51-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Instagram"`, `brand = "Piko"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `instagram-piko-clone-v439.0.0.37.89-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Prime Video"`, `brand = "Android TV"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `prime-video-android-tv-clone-v3.0.354-arm-v7a.apk`
- `app-name = "TikTok"`, `brand = "Morphe"`, `sub-variant = "alt"` ➔ `tiktok-morphe-alt-v37.5.4-arm64-v8a.apk`
- `app-name = "Disney+"`, `brand = "Android TV"`, `sub-variant = "clone"` ➔ `disney-android-tv-clone-v3.0.354-arm-v7a.apk`

## Mirrored apps

`mirror = true` turns an app into a plain re-host of its stock APK: nothing is patched, so
no CLI or patch bundle is fetched and none of the patch keys apply. It exists so an app that
publishes no GitHub release of its own can still be tracked (e.g. by Obtainium) from this
repository.

```toml
mirror = true            # file-level default for a "stock apps" file
brand = "Mirror"         # metadata only; a mirrored file name has no brand segment
version = "latest"       # 'latest' or an explicit version. 'auto', 'exp' and 'beta' are refused: there are no patches to resolve them against
arch = "arm64-v8a"

[Bitget]
app-name = "Bitget"
pkg-name = "com.bitget.exchange"
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/bg-limited/bitget-buy-sell-crypto/"

[Duck-Detector]
app-name = "Duck Detector"
pkg-name = "com.eltavine.duckdetector"
keep-filename = true     # a nightly has no version number to put in a name: the asset keeps its own
version = "nightly"
arch = "all"
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/eltavine/Duck-Detector-Refactoring/releases/tag/nightly"
```

- **Rejected, not ignored:** `patches-source`, `cli-source`, `included-patches`, `excluded-patches`,
  `exclusive-patches`, `inclusive-patches`, `patcher-args`, `patched-pkg-name`, `include-stock`
  and a `build-mode` other than `apk` on a mirrored app abort the run, as does `keep-filename`
  on an app that is not mirrored. Keep file-level defaults for patched keys out of a file that
  holds mirrored apps.
- **File name:** `<app-slug>-v<version>-<arch>.apk`, the same grammar as every other asset, so
  releases, manifests and Obtainium filters treat it like any build.
- **Signature:** a plain APK is published byte for byte. A bundle (`.xapk`/`.apkm`/`.apks`) source
  is merged into one APK, which re-signs it; prefer a source that serves a plain APK if the
  mirror has to update over a store install.
- **Identity:** the APK's real package id is what gets published. For `github`/`direct` sources a
  `pkg-name` that differs from it is a warning (you named the file); for a store scrape it is a
  rejection.
- **When it rebuilds:** only when the app itself updates in a tracked store. A patch release never
  rebuilds a mirrored app.

## Multiple Patch Sources

You can pass multiple patch bundles to the CLI by specifying `patches-source` as a quoted list (same format as `excluded-patches`).
When using multiple sources, the CLI merges the patch bundles. However, please see the **Current Limitations** below regarding `included-patches` and `excluded-patches`.

```toml
# single-line format
patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"

# multiline format
patches-source = """\
  'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' \
  'other/patches' \
  """

# If all sources are on the same host, a single string applies to all:
patches-source-host = "github"

# If sources span different hosts, provide one value per source in order:
patches-source-host = "'github' 'gitlab'"        # any of github | gitlab | codeberg

# Same rule applies to patches-version:
patches-version = "stable"                        # applies to all sources
patches-version = "'stable' 'v1.2.3'"             # per-source versions
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Codeberg sources** (`"codeberg"`) are read through Forgejo's GitHub-compatible API:
> stable vs beta is the same `prerelease` flag GitHub uses, drafts are ignored, and the
> listing is requested with `limit=50` because that API silently ignores `per_page`. The
> bundle is downloaded from the release asset's `browser_download_url`, whatever the file
> is called (`app-release.apk` is common for Xposed modules), and the changelog link is
> built as `https://codeberg.org/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tag/<tag>`.

> [!TIP]
> **Per-bundle patch selection**: When using multiple sources, separate patch lists 
> with `|` to control each bundle independently:
> ```toml
> patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"
> excluded-patches = "'Patch A' | 'Patch B'"    # Patch A from bundle 1, Patch B from bundle 2
> included-patches = "'' | 'Patch X'"           # nothing from bundle 1, Patch X from bundle 2
> ```
> Without `|`, the same list applies to all bundles (backward compatible).

## Xposed Modules (NPatch / LSPatch)

You can natively inject Xposed modules into an app using `7723mod/NPatch` or `LSPatch` directly from your config. Simply set the `cli-source` to the NPatch repository and the `patches-source` to the Xposed module repository.

```toml
[Discord]
cli-source = "7723mod/NPatch"                            # Use NPatch as the CLI
cli-version = "stable"
patches-source = "revenge-mod/revenge-xposed"            # Provide the Xposed module as the patches bundle
patches-version = "stable"
version = "auto"                                         # 'auto' safely falls back to 'latest' since modules don't list supported versions
arch = "auto"
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/discord/releases/..." # Or apkmirror, etc.
```

When the script detects `npatch` or `lspatch` in the CLI source, it will automatically bypass ReVanced CLI arguments and execute the correct injection command. You can also pass extra options to NPatch using `patcher-args = "-l 2"`.

## Instafel Patcher (Instagram Alpha)

You can natively build Instagram Alpha using the Instafel Patcher engine (`instafel/p-rel`) and Patcher Core (`instafel/pc-rel`).

```toml
[instagram-instafel]
cli-source = "instafel/p-rel"                            # Use Instafel Patcher CLI
cli-version = "stable"
patches-source = "instafel/pc-rel"                       # Provide Instafel Patcher Core
patches-version = "stable"
included-patches = "'unlock_developer_options' 'remove_snooze_warning' 'remove_ads' 'instafel'"
```

## Morphe Bundle Passthrough

When the tool is **morphe-desktop** (`cli-source = "MorpheApp/morphe-desktop"`,
the default) and the stock download is a bundle format (`.xapk`/`.apkm`/`.apks`),
the engine keeps the vendor bundle as the cache artifact and hands it to morphe
directly instead of pre-merging it with apkeditor. Morphe merges bundles
natively, and some apps misbehave after apkeditor's rewrite+re-sign, so this
produces cleaner patched APKs and avoids caching two copies of the same app.

No merge is performed at all in this mode, for any download source: the engine
extracts the bundle's `base.apk` purely so the usual package / versionName /
versionCode checks have a real APK to read, and leaves the bundle untouched for
patching. (Until now the merge still ran and its output was deleted minutes later
when the bundle was adopted — an apkeditor JVM start and a full archive pass per
bundle download, for nothing.)

- **Scope**: automatic — no per-app config. Applies per build when the download
  is a bundle; plain `.apk` stocks and all other patcher tools (revanced family,
  Xposed, instafel) are untouched.
- **Cache**: a bundle is stored under the ABIs it actually carries, read off its
  contents: `${pkg}-${version}-${versionCode}-all.xapk` when it holds every arm ABI or
  none, and `${pkg}-${version}-${versionCode}-arm64-v8a.xapk` when it holds only that
  one (`.apkm`/`.apks` likewise). A universal bundle is shared: for `arch = all`/`auto`
  it goes to morphe whole, and for `arm64-v8a`/`arm-v7a`/`x86`/`x86_64` the engine
  strips only the *other ABIs'* `config.*` members (a `zip -d`, no merge, no re-sign)
  and passes the trimmed bundle, so switching an app from `all` to `both`/`arm64-v8a`
  reuses the cached bundle rather than re-downloading.
  That sharing rested on a premise that is not always true: APKPure and APKCombo publish
  *per-arch* bundles (atvTools 1.3.2 arm64 = base + `config.arm64_v8a` +
  `config.xxxhdpi`, nothing else). Stored as `-all`, such a bundle was adopted by the
  `arm-v7a` build, which trimmed away the only ABI split it had and then failed in the
  patcher for want of `lib/armeabi-v7a`. Keys now come from the artifact, so a build can
  only find a bundle that is able to serve it.
- **Module stock**: `include-stock = merged` merges from the cached bundle on
  demand (throwaway, never cached); `split` reads the bundle directly; `disable`
  needs nothing. All three work with passthrough active.
- **Cache repo (`nullcpy/apks`)**: the bundle is uploaded as-is (it is the file
  the build used); the downloader side already accepts bundle extensions.
- **Kill switch**: set the repo variable `RVB_MORPHE_PASSTHROUGH=false`
  (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) to revert to the old
  merge-at-download behavior without a code change. Existing merged-`.apk`
  cache entries keep working for any non-morphe tool.

## Modular Configuration Directory & Dynamic Pool Routing

Configurations are organized in `configs/patches/*.toml` (e.g. `morphe.toml`, `anddea.toml`, `piko.toml`, `ajstrick81.toml`).

You do **not** need separate files for stable and beta:
- **Single-File Co-existence**: All variants and builds for a brand or patch source can reside in the same `.toml` file.
- **Top-Level Inheritance**: Keys defined at the top of the file before the first `[...]` header (such as `patches-source`, `brand`, `variant`, and `patches-version`) act as file-level defaults. Apps automatically inherit them, keeping app blocks concise and DRY.
- **Default CLI Engine**: `cli-source` defaults to `"MorpheApp/morphe-desktop"` globally and can be completely omitted unless using alternative tools like `7723mod/NPatch` or `instafel/p-rel`.
- **Dynamic Pool Routing**:
  - **Stable Only (Default)**: If neither the file-level header nor the app specifies `patches-version`, the app is automatically compiled into the **stable** build pool only.
  - **Both Pools**: Setting `patches-version = "both"` (at the top of the file or in an app block) compiles the app into **both** stable and beta pools.
  - **Beta Only**: Setting `patches-version = "beta"` routes the app exclusively to the beta (pre-release) build pool.
  - **File-Level Defaults**: Setting `patches-version = "both"` (or `"beta"`) at the top applies that channel to all apps in the file unless individually overridden.
  - **Filename Inference**: A filename with `.beta.toml` automatically defaults all apps in that file to beta. Renaming to `*.toml` defaults to stable unless `patches-version = "both"` is set. (A legacy `.dev.toml` spelling is no longer recognized — a source named like `devanced.toml` would otherwise be mistaken for one.)
  - **Concrete Version Pins**: A version number instead of a channel (e.g. `patches-version = "v4.8.3"`) pins that exact release — one app when written in an app block, every app in the file when written at the top level. The generated pool config carries it verbatim and nothing rewrites it.
  - **Channel Resolution**: `"stable"` and `"beta"` are the only channel keywords, and they stay as keywords in the generated config; the build resolves each source's keyword against `state/patch_sources.json`, the watcher's record of that source's current release per channel. One source of truth instead of a stamped copy that can go stale, and a build run is consistent with the state it was generated from because `configs/` and `state/` come from the same `main` commit. A source with no release recorded on that channel falls back to listing the releases live. Any other word is treated as a release tag, so a mistyped channel fails on the release lookup rather than building the wrong thing.
  - **Blocked Sources**: when the forge answers `404` (deleted or renamed), `451` (legal takedown) or `403` (private or access refused), the watcher marks that source `blocked` and freezes its last known tags. A build then **skips every app using it** - keyword or pinned version alike - instead of querying the releases endpoint, because neither a retry nor a live listing can recover a repository that is gone. The app is logged as "Could not get prebuilts" and the run moves on; it comes back on its own once the source is reachable again.
  - **Disabling an App**: Set `enabled = false` to disable an app across all pools.

## Automated Patch Sources State Tracking

> **Where configs and state live:** all on `main`, tracked like code.
>
> - `configs/config.manual.toml`, `configs/patches/*.toml` — **yours**: edit and
>   commit them normally.
> - `configs/stable_build.json`, `configs/beta_build.json` — generated pool
>   configs, written by the watcher only (`commit_to_main.sh`).
> - `state/*.json` (`patch_sources`, `app_versions`, `patch_file_hashes`) —
>   machine state, written by the watcher only.
> - `state/manifests/`, `state/archive/` — build manifests, written by each build.
>
> CI commits those generated files to `main` between your edits, so `git pull`
> before you edit. Never hand-edit the JSON; to force a state change, delete the
> entry and let the watcher rebuild it. Why one branch:
> [docs/decisions/0008](docs/decisions/0008-one-branch.md).

Patch sources and their release versions in `state/patch_sources.json` are **100% automated**:
- The CI automatically scans all `.toml` files, discovers every active `patches-source` repository and host (`github`, `gitlab` or `codeberg`), and checks for new stable and beta releases.
- Unreferenced or deleted patch sources are pruned automatically.
- **You do not need to manually edit `patch_sources.json`.** Simply add or update `patches-source` in your `.toml` files.
- The build reads this file to turn a `patches-version = "stable"|"beta"` keyword into a concrete tag, so it is the answer to "what is the current release" for both the watcher and the builder.
- A `blocked: true` entry is the watcher's record that the repository cannot be reached (404/451/403, on any of the three forges). Its tags are kept as they were, and the build refuses to use them - it skips the app rather than spend a request on a dead repository.

## Automatic App Version Checking

The CI workflow automatically detects when a new version of an app is released on APKMirror, Uptodown, or Archive.org.

### How it Works
1. **Version Fetching**: During the CI run, it reads all enabled apps from the `configs/patches/*.toml` configurations and queries the URLs (`uptodown-dlurl`, `apkmirror-dlurl`, etc.).
2. **Comparison**: It checks the newly fetched versions against the currently stored versions in `state/app_versions.json`.
3. **Triggering**: If a new version is detected, the app is added to a temporary `active_apps.json` list, and the CI is triggered to build it.
### Tracking File
App versions are permanently tracked in `state/app_versions.json` (on `main`, see above).
You can manually update this file if you need to force a specific version state, but the CI will automatically manage it during scheduled runs.

**Selective Checking:** If you only want the CI to check specific apps (instead of all enabled apps in your config), you can add `"_check_only_listed": true` to the top level of `app_versions.json`. When this is true, the script will only check for updates for the apps that already exist as keys in the file, saving time and resources.

## Release Cleanup & Catalog Architecture

Maintenance and cleanup workflows keep GitHub Releases and changelogs pruned. The
website catalog (`data.json` on `nullcpy.github.io`) is **derived, not edited**: every
build's metadata lives in a `build.json` manifest under `state/` on the repo's `main` and
the website repo regenerates its catalog from scratch by folding those manifests
against the live releases API.

### Release Manifests (`build.json`)
- **What**: a per-release, filename-keyed JSON manifest describing every APK/module
  in that release — app identity, brand, variant, version, arch, patch sources and
  `appliedPatches`. Schema documented in `.github/scripts/build_make_manifest.py`.
- **Numbered releases**: the builder generates one manifest per build
  (`build_make_manifest.py` → `temp/manifest/build.json`); it is committed to the
  repository as `state/manifests/<tag>.json`, not uploaded as a release asset.
- **Archive releases (`stable`/`beta`)**: after each archive file upload,
  `merge_archive_manifest.sh` reads the cumulative `state/archive/<channel>.json`
  from `main`, unions the new build's entries with it (same filename = file
  replaced = metadata replaced), drops entries whose file no longer exists in
  the release, and commits it with `state/manifests/<tag>.json` alongside. The archive therefore carries cumulative metadata for every file it
  contains, even after the originating numbered release is deleted — and the
  git history makes any manifest loss recoverable via `git log -p` /
  `git show <rev>:state/archive/stable.json`.
- **Backfill**: `.github/scripts/backfill_manifests.py` (run with `--apply`) can
  regenerate manifests on all live releases from a healthy `data.json` (one-time
  migration tool; dry run by default).

### Website Rebuild (nullcpy.github.io repo)
`.github/workflows/rebuild-catalog.yml` runs on `repository_dispatch
(catalog-updated)` — sent fire-and-forget by `build.yml` and `cleanup.yml` — plus a
scheduled safety net. It sparse-clones `state/` of this repo's `main` for the
manifests (plus fetches live releases for existence, sizes, and download
counts), regenerates `data.json` (schema v2) from scratch, and pushes only on
material change. Deletions are automatic: a release or asset that no longer
exists simply doesn't appear. Circuit breakers abort a rebuild (leaving
`data.json` untouched) if the releases API looks empty (< 10 releases) or the
catalog shrinks beyond `MIN_RATIO` (default 0.6); `FORCE=1` overrides.
Releases without a manifest get minimal filename-derived fallback entries.

### Automated Routine Cleanup (`cleanup.yml`)
- **Numbered Releases**: Retains the latest 98 numbered releases via `ophub/delete-releases-workflows`. Keeping 98 *is* the catalog's history window — deleted releases vanish from the website, which is correct since their files are gone.
- **Archive Releases**: Retains rolling `stable` and `beta` releases, keeping up to 2 versions per asset group via `cleanup-archive-assets.py`. Pruned assets drop out of the catalog automatically at the next rebuild.
- **Manifests**: `cleanup_manifests.sh` deletes `state/manifests/<tag>.json` for numbered releases that no longer exist (same pattern as the update branch's changelog pruning).
- Ends with a fire-and-forget `catalog-updated` dispatch so the website reflects deletions promptly.

### Full Clean Slate / Rebuilding from Scratch
To completely wipe all historical releases (including `stable` and `beta`):
1. In `.github/workflows/cleanup.yml`, set:
   ```yaml
   releases_keep_latest: 0
   workflows_keep_day: 0
   # (omit releases_keep_keyword: stable/beta)
   ```
2. Trigger the **Cleanup** workflow via `workflow_dispatch`. All past releases, tags,
   and workflow logs are purged.
3. In the **website repo**, run Rebuild Catalog with `FORCE=1` (edit the workflow env or
   temporarily raise `MIN_RELEASES_THRESHOLD=0`) to publish an empty catalog; the
   breaker would otherwise refuse to write with < 10 live releases.
4. Subsequent CI builds author clean numbered releases, rolling archives, and fresh
   manifests; every website rebuild thereafter is derived from whatever is live.
5. **Restoring Routine Configuration**: restore `cleanup.yml` to standard retention:
   ```yaml
   releases_keep_latest: 98
   releases_keep_keyword: stable/beta
   workflows_keep_day: 0
   ```
