# Project documentation

The root [README](../README.md) speaks to users of the builds. This folder
describes the **system**: two repositories, four Git branches, GitHub Releases,
a website catalogue, and the CI that keeps them consistent. It is written for
people changing the pipeline and for AI agents asked to do so.

## Where to start

| You want to… | Read |
|---|---|
| understand the whole shape before touching anything | [architecture.md](architecture.md) |
| change CI behaviour, trigger gating, uploads | [ci-pipelines.md](ci-pipelines.md) |
| change how an APK is fetched, patched, packaged, signed | [build-engine.md](build-engine.md) |
| know where a file lives, who writes it, how to recover it | [storage-and-branches.md](storage-and-branches.md) |
| work on the catalogue the website renders (`data.json`) | [website-contract.md](website-contract.md) |
| understand or debug the stock-APK cache (`nullcpy/apks`) | [cache-repo.md](cache-repo.md) |
| run this as your own fork (bootstrap branches, settings, first run) | [fork-setup.md](fork-setup.md) |
| follow the builds with Obtainium (links, filters, import file) | [../OBTAINIUM.md](../OBTAINIUM.md) |
| make any change: setup, tests, commit and publish rules | [contributing.md](contributing.md) |
| brief an AI agent with the shortest correct context | [ai-context.md](ai-context.md) |
| know *why* a rule exists and what was rejected | [decisions/](decisions/) |

## What is deliberately not repeated here

Each fact has exactly one owner. Linking to it is fine; copying it is how it
rots.

| Topic | Owner |
|---|---|
| Every TOML key the builder accepts | [CONFIG.md](../CONFIG.md) |
| Release-manifest scripts, repair tooling, uploader knobs | [.github/scripts/README.md](../.github/scripts/README.md) |
| Offline regression harness (fixtures, goldens, stubs) | [.github/traces/README.md](../.github/traces/README.md) |
| Website UI, `data.json` schema v2, `script.js` config, Obtainium flow | [`nullcpy.github.io/CONFIG.md`](https://github.com/nullcpy/nullcpy.github.io/blob/main/CONFIG.md) |
| Contributing APKs to the cache (`upload_apks.*`, write access, renaming) | [`nullcpy/apks/README.md`](https://github.com/nullcpy/apks/blob/main/README.md) |

## How to keep these files honest

- Structure and boundaries belong here; behaviour details belong in the script
  they describe. If a paragraph here restates what the code already says, delete
  the paragraph.
- Anything with a wire format — file names, branch paths, JSON keys, URL shapes —
  is listed in [storage-and-branches.md](storage-and-branches.md) with its
  producer and consumer. Add to that table when you introduce one.
- When a decision is load-bearing (someone will be tempted to undo it), write a
  numbered file in [decisions/](decisions/) and link it from the code comment
  that guards it.
- Dates are written in full (`2026-09-25`). Incident dates are how the recovery
  notes in these files stay searchable.
